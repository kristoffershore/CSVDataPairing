# CSVDataPairing
This script analyzes columns of a csv file to pair instances of related data on the same row for future use as a csv import. In my original use case it was used to pair product SKUs with their respective image files that contain the product SKU in their filename. It is also useful for csv price updates with a little repurposing. You could paste a column of SKU's exported from your own catalog and then pair them with the SKUs and prices on a manufacturers price list.
